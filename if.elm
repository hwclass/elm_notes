{-| But maybe we want a more nuanced review of power levels. So we are
defining the assessPowerLevel function that will give different
assessments based on how close you are to 9000.

Try swapping out `isOver9000` for `assessPowerLevel` in the definition
of `assessments` above. I want to see the the nicer reviews!
